# HVUAN (Humanos Virtuales Universidad Antonio Nari√±o)
This is a virtual agent interaction framework for Spanish speaking virtual humans (a.k.a embodied conversational agents). 
It relies on UTEP's VAIF (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeNXKQvJzFep08mEc2e7-Ig) and Windows Cortana, among others.

To create a VH from scratch without a graphic designer:
